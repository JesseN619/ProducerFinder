ProducerFinder solves the problem of not knowing who the producer of a song is. The producer of a song is responsible for most of the sound of a song, however, they get very little credit. You may want to hear similar sounding songs, produced by that same producer of a song you like.

ProducerFinder allows you search a song's title to find that producer's name and their most popular songs. If Spotify snippets are available, they can be played. You can sign in with your Spotify account to create a new playlist or choose an existing playlist and add the producer's songs to those playlists or delete songs.

ProducerFinder was built with TypeScript, React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, and it utilizes the Genius API and Spotify API. React and Redux were used to organize code and manage state across components.
